### Intro
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.

**Goal**

The target is to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 

The following points are the key success factors:
- Background knowledge of dataset(s).
- Communication of motivation: why do we care?
- Research questions of interest: what do you want to find out?
- Answers to research questions: what have you uncovered?
- Balance of complexity and simplicity.
- Explanation of future work: what would you do if given more time, data, etc.?
- Demonstration of EDA skills (Numeric/graphic methodology)
- Demonstration of machine learning skills (Supervised/unsupervised methodology)
- Ability to assess model weaknesses and identify improvements.
- Hyperparameters tuning
- Model performance summarized
